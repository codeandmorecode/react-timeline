// For wave 1 implement the TimelineEvent component function. It should take 3 props.

// person - the person making the post.
// status - the message being posted.
// timestamp - the date-time of the event.
// Test the component by rendering it with hardcoded data inside the App component. TimelineEvent should use the existing Timestamp component to render the time & date of the event.
